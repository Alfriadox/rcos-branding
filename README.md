# RCOS Branding
Rensselaer Center for Open Source brand assets

All files are stored in the `/img` directory and were generated from the `RCOS.ai` source file. Edits to this file will require a license of [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).

There is also `RCOS.svg` which was generated from the `.ai` file and is in an open format which can be easily edited with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or similar software.

Our [Brand Standards](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/resources/brand_standards) are detailed in the [RCOS Handbook](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/).
